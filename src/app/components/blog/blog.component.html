        <p><span class="quote">‘after a lifetime in silence and darkness to be deaf is a greater affliction than to be blind...Hearing is the soul of knowledge and information of a high order. To be cut off from hearing is to be isolated indeed’ </span> <strong>
          <br>-Hellen Keller</strong></p>
        <br>
        <p>
          It’s quite telling that well over 50 years after the death of American deaf and blind pioneer author Hellen Keller and with technological advancement moving faster than we can blink, no technology has targeted deaf people. None so far has been fully developed to help ease the burden of communication and isolation that deaf people carry everyday of their lives.</p>
        <p>Deafness is one the most misunderstood disabilities. It’s the silent disability. The man who didn’t return your greetings in the bus while sitting next to you was probably deaf not a snob. The lady who smiled and kept walking when you called out was probably deaf. But how could anyone know? Indeed, for those who enjoy normal hearing, it may seem a strange concept that one can stand in a room full of people engaged in excited conversation, bonding and enjoying each other’s company and yet one in the group feel awkward and terribly alone.</p>
        <p>There are two broad categories of deaf people; <strong>pre-lingual</strong> deaf and <strong>post-lingual</strong> deaf. The pre-lingual deaf are those born deaf or became deaf at such an early stage that their language and speech is severely affected. They therefore rely entirely on sign language as a mode of communication. They form a large percentage of the deaf population in any given country. In Kenya for example this group is normally associate with capital D in deaf.</p>
        <p>The second group is the post lingual deaf popularly known as hard of hearing (HoH), into which I fall. This are the deaf who lost their hearing later in life after acquiring speech. The hearing loss is most often as a result of medical conditions such as meningitis. HoH are capable of speech but incapable of hearing. Among the deaf of Kenya, we are categorized with small letter d in deaf.</p>
        <p>The most common assumption is that the HoH have it easier than the pre-lingual deaf due to their ability to speak. Nothing could be farther from the truth. Sudden hearing loss present an almost crippling form of emotional and psychosocial debilitation. One minute you have friends and the next minute you don’t have any friends.</p>
        <p>Both pre and post-lingual deaf face a myriad of challenges at home and also at work. For a long time, interpreters have been used to bridge the communication gap between the deaf and the hearing and they have done a good job thus far.</p>
        <p>One area which has been left out like a sore thumb is the area of medical services. Deaf people abhor visiting hospitals and majority prefer to self-diagnose and medicate. <strong>Why so?</strong> </p>
        <p>In my 15 years’ interaction with deaf people and drawing from my own experiences one of the biggest fear is an acute lack of privacy. There exists a doctor to patient privilege much like attorney/client privilege but there is no interpreter/deaf privilege or if it exists then it’s not in force. The deaf community is a small tightknit community bound together by a common language (sign language). One interpreter is known to almost any other deaf person as such fear of one’s medical diagnosis coming out is huge.</p>
        <p>It’s also worth noting that very few deaf people in Kenya today can afford interpreters. Majority of the Kenyan deaf population are either unemployed or doing menial jobs whereas interpreters charge upwards of 5 dollars an hour. This puts them out of reach of the common deaf patient.</p>
        <p>As a result, many people either self-medicate or visit hospitals without interpreters. This leads misdiagnosis since the communication between the doctor and the deaf patient is limited. In the case of pre-lingual deaf their grasp of written English is poor and hence limits their ability to explain themselves in writing or even respond to and follow doctors’ orders. The post-lingual deaf are often able to explain self rather well however they have difficulties understanding verbal instructions from doctors (even written ones since doctors and poor handwriting).</p>
        <p>Writing also proves a challenge as doctors in most public health facilities are pressed for time and overwhelmed by the large number of patients seeking their services. Doctors will not have enough time to sit down with the deaf patient and patiently write down all that is needed. This will most likely lead to a misdiagnosis which might worsen the patient situation.</p>
        <p>In some hospitals the situation is so dire that the deaf patient is either turned away or seen last after all the other patient have been attended to. All these makes it extremely difficult for deaf people to seek and receive appropriate healthcare.</p>
        <p>It was upon seeing all these challenges that Its Ability Kenya came up with the concept of machine learning to help lift the communication barrier between the deaf and medical practitioners in a way that respects and promotes the doctor client privilege and is easily accessible and affordable.</p>
        <p>Our machine learning platform is will be readily available to all people at all times and will translate sign language into written/spoken format and also translate spoken word into signed/written format. This will eliminate the need by the deaf to carry an interpreter into consultation rooms while providing a cheap and readily available communication platform for clear and private consultation devoid of any fear or shame.</p>
        <p>It’s our hope that with time we shall develop the platform to incorporate all aspects of social life so that the deaf will be able to interact with people from all walks of life without any inhibitions whatsoever and in so doing overcome one of Hellen Keller’s greatest regrets when she opined that <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold">‘blindness separates people from things…. Deafness separates people from people’.</span> </p>
        <p>Let us be the generation that ended the separation of the deaf from other people.</p>
